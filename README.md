Summary
-------

This is a simple jQuery-based, multiplayer game clock implementing "simple delay" ([explanation][wiki]).  It was a little experiment to learn jQuery, and keep our house's Settlers of Catan games moving along smoothly.  It runs great in a browser, on Android at least.  A demo is online [here][demo].
